# 🔐 PRODIGY_CS_02 – AES Text Encryption Tool (GUI)

This educational project demonstrates **text encryption and decryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** via a simple GUI built in Python.

## ✨ Features
- Encrypt any text using AES (128-bit key)
- Decrypt previously encrypted base64 ciphertext
- GUI built with `tkinter`
- Uses ECB mode for simplicity (educational focus)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required package:
```
pip install pycryptodome
```

2. Run the application:
```
python aes_gui.py
```

## ⚠️ Note
- This tool is for educational use only.
- AES key must be **exactly 16 characters** for 128-bit encryption.
